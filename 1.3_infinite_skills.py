1.3.infinite_skills
'''
Unfortunately, I do not have any infinite programming skills. 
I barely have any regular programming skills at all. But taking this class will help me achieve this goal.
My end goal is to become a good if not great programmer and learn as many codes as possible. 
I want to make a new website for myself thats about me. I also wanna code and make an app.
It could be for a game or just informational
